# TO-DO: thorough testing (some initial testing completed, but passing the code to David to develop
#        before everything has been fully verified)
# TO-DO: check the validity of the binary info gain method and implement the early abandon as
#        in original shapelet paper (not possible for non-binary IG however)
# TO-DO: revisit contract timing - currently it's lazy (will process the last shapelet and go over the limit)
#        A more sensible approach would be to estimate the average/median/max shapelet calculation time and
#        only process a new candidate if there is enough time left. Max would be safest but most conservative
#        estimate, mean is easiest to calculate without storing/sorting run-times. Investigation req.
# TO-DO: Random and ContractedRandom transforms use all of the same logic but have different class types for
#        distinctions (Contracted extends Random with flags to set). However, Tony would now prefer to have a
#        single class with a flag for contract or not, so code should be refactored into a single class
# TO-DO: Transform currently only for univariate data - once all of the above is reconciled we should extend
#        to the multi-variate case (should be fairly simple - done in Java, though not sure on the specifics/how
#        complete it is and if we could use mutivariate data in other ways too
# TO-DO: Currently extends TransformerMixin - class should extend the sktime transformer base class (not on dev at
#        branch at time of writing however so this can be updated later)
# TO-DO: Add a parameter to cap the number of shapelets to use in the final transform. Not done yet as we should
#        look at the Java implementation to see what the default was. If there isn't one, we could use an
#        arbitrary value such as 200 as a default? The limit would be after all shapelets are extracted and sorted
#        in descending order of information gain (e.g. keep the top 200 shapelets, not the first 200 that
#        were visited)
# TO-DO: verbose output of time remaining for contract is currently in decimal format, e.g.:
#        > Candidate finished. 0.418 minutes remaining.
#        it would be nicer (but not that important) to convert this to mins:secs rather than a decimal for minutes
#        e.g. 5:45 left, rather than 5.75
